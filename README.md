4dfp Methods.

This repository builds on the 4dfp suite of image registration codes written by Avi Snyder at Washington Univesity in Saint Louis.  The original 4dfp codes are not provided.
The new methods:

  - provide interoperability with NIfTI and MGH imaging formats
  - provide Matlab interfaces to 4dfp executables and 4dfp data files such as 4dfp.ifh and 4dfp.img.rec
  - perform registration of dynamic PET data across imaging frames and across tracer studies
  - generate mu-maps from CT using Carney's method
  - provide diagnostic information for the t4_resolve method of the 4dfp suite
